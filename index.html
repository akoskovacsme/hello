      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p><a href="">#FF5656</a> means a series of numbers for you. But it can be a good color for a button. This is how I realize the world around me over 8 years.</p>
      <p>I always preferred the community-based knowledge, that’s why I trained myself. My skills/perspective came from the digital world. But I never forget the oldest tools: paper and pen to sketch my ideas. I always looking for new challenges in my life/career. I’m curious that’s the motivation for me. That was the reason why I choosed UI/UX community when I decided to leave the print materials.
      </p>
      <p>No matters how many times I should redesign the creative because we need to find the highest quality or closest answer to the solution. Imho new games/apps/methods are always fun especially the difficult ones. Maybe this is the source of my beta addictions.
      </p>
      <p>What is the value in a company? I really love working with talented people and I’m open to learning from them. It’s important for me to educate myself. This is why I really love to ask always.</p>
      <p>
      I have to note I’m not perfect, it’s really hard for me to remember people’s name and I don’t like tofu.
